title: "SpMp"
description: "A YouTube Music client I've been making since August 2022.
I've implemented useful queue manipulation features, as well as language and metadata customisation options.
Seeing poor song title translations on a daily basis in the official app and not being able to change them was a great motivator."

{{< projectheader >}}

I started this project after I got tired of dealing with YouTube's official music app's lack of language features and customisation. I tried several alternatives, but all had at least a few issues that bugged me.

So instead of spending a few weeks learning the codebase of an existing project and contributing to it, I decided to spend almost a year (as of writing) creating my own solution.
