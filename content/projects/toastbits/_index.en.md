My personal website. Features a list of my projects, among other things.

Built with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) using a [heavily modified version](https://github.com/toasterofbread/hugo-theme-monochrome) of the [Monochrome theme](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hugo-theme-monochrome). Themed using [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).
