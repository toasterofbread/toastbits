A project I started as an entry to the 2021 Github Game Off, involving an in-game scripting language.
Implementing a language in GDScript was a lot harder than I had expected, but I was able to get basic logic, functions, and variables working.
It became clear pretty quickly that I wouldn't finish it in time for submission, but it was still worth it for the experience.
