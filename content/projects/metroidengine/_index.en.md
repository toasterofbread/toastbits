# Super Metroid in Godot

A remake of Super Metroid's Samus using the original assets.
The first project I created with the Godot Engine over the course of about two weeks in summer 2020.
All the basic movement mechanics from Super are implemented, except the grapple beam.
Metroid projects are a running theme for me, apparently.
